## **DATA SOURCE**

Link: [Citi Bike System Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

For this project, only the years 2019 and 2020 were utilized.

## **OBSERVATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS**

### **_2019 vs 2020 Ridership_**

Upon visual inspection, 2020 shows a decrease in ridership when compared with 2019. This can be explained by government restrictions and other infection-prevention protocols that were in place due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

### **_Seasonality_**

Ridership peaks during the summer months for both 2019 and 2020, while it decreases significantly during winter. Weather affects ridership -- on cold and rainy days, ridership drops, while warmer temperatures encourage usage of the bike share service.

### **_Weekly and Hourly Trends_**

More trips are taken during the weekdays as compared to the weekends. Moreover, on weekdays, from 7am-9am and 5pm-7pm, ridership peaks. Weekdays are equated to workdays, wherein you see people commuting to work, school, etc. Usual commuting times are between 7am-9am (to get to the workplace or school) and 5pm-7pm (to return home).

### **_User Demographics_**

1. Gender  
   Data showed that there are more male users than females.

2. User Type
   There are more subscribers than non-subscribers who utilize the bike share service. Logically, it follows that paying for a subscription means that it is a service needed by the subscriber with great regularity.

### **_Trip Duration_**

Non-subscribers, on average, take longer trips, than subscribers. An easy explanation is that subscribers have a set routine and motivation for using the bike share service, like, commuting to work. In contrast, non-subscribers may not have a particular itenerary or maybe using the service to explore the city without a set time limit in mind.
